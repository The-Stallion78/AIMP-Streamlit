# You can add more content to the main page if needed.
# For example, a brief overview of the project or instructions.

# To ensure the Pages directory is recognized, you might want to explicitly
# list the pages in the sidebar if Streamlit's automatic page discovery
# isn't working as expected, though it usually does for files in 'pages/'.
